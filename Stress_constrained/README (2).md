# An efficient 146-line 3D sensitivity analysis code of stress-based topology optimization written in MATLAB

Please run the MATLAB program `run_stress_min.m` for the first numerical example in the paper.

**Recommended environment:** MATLAB 2020a

## Introduction

The repository here is for the paper: [An efficient 146-line 3D sensitivity analysis code of stress-based topology optimization written in MATLAB](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11081-021-09675-3). The 146 lines code includes the finite element analysis and p-norm stress sensitivity based on the adjoint method, verified by finite difference approximation. The code uses the [Method of Moving Asymptotes (MMA) Optimizer](http://www.smoptit.se/) as the nonlinear optimizer. The finite element formulation is derived from the paper by Liu et al.: [An efficient 3D topology optimization code written in Matlab](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00158-014-1107-x). More details about the formulation can be found there. The code can be extended for different stress related 3D topology optimization problems and is intended for educational purposes.
